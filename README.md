# Black-Hole-Sort
My attempt at creating a generic sorting algorithm with O(n) time complexity.

## What is Black Hole Sort?
I got the idea for Black Hole sort after watching a video about QuickSort. That video claimed that some dude in the 1970s proved that you could not create a comparitive sorting algorithm faster than O(nlogn). So obviously, I had to try and prove him wrong.

As far as I can tell, as this code is implemented, it is indeed O(n) and ChatGPT conditionally agrees when I tell it to, so it must be true, right?

Right now, the code itself probably sucks big time. I'm certain that it's absolutely chock-full of unoptimized code. That's why I'm making it a public repo. Hopefully this will help it gain a bit of traction.

You can take a look at Black Hole Algorithm Explained for an in-depth on how it works.
