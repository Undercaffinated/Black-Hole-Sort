For all your reading needs, check out the docs folder. There you will find the high-level descriptions of how BHS works and whatever other documentation you might require.

For language-specific information, example code, and language-specific benchmarks, check out the folder titled with your preferred language. If the folder doesn't exist, then there is currently no support for your particular language.

**IMPORTANT: There is no guarantee that the code you find in each language folder is in any way optimal. In fact, it almost certainly isn't. Copy/Paste at your own risk!**

*Side Note: I can only add languages I know or can take the time to learn. If you are an experienced enough dev (1+ hours experience), feel free to contribute!*

# Vocab

Since I'm *lazy* I tend to use a lot of contractions. Here's what you need to know:

BHS - Black Hole Sort: The complete implementation of my sorting algorithm. More details in docs/how_bhs_works.md

BHA - Black Hole Algorithm: Synonymous to BHS.  *Just know this one. I'm working on removing it to be more consistent with BHS, but again, lazy.*

GRL - Graph Reduction Loop: The less sexy name for the underlying process that makes BHS work.
