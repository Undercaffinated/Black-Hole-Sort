# Project Dependencies

You will need these things in order to take full advantage of this project. This list is meant for those who are relatively new to the languages used in the project and may not know how to get them to run.

## JavaScript

All of the JS code is written in vanilla JS with no additional dependencies. I have been using the latest version of node.js as my runtime environment.

## Python

This project is built using Python3. None of the code is too advanced, so I assume any version of Python3 or greater will work.

The project utilizes the pandas module for doing data analysis. Without this module, many python scripts may not work.

## Rust
The Rust crate included in this project should be able to manage fetching all of the required dependencies.
